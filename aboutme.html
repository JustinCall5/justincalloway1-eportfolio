		<p <p align="center">My Name is Justin Calloway. I was born in Brooklyn,New York  on May 18th. I enjoy all around digital art and in my spare time im either playing games or designing banners for my friends and family. As I continue my journey further into animation and design, I intend on gathering as much creative information I can, in order to become a film animator or game designer for a company. Please enjoy your time here on my website.</p>
